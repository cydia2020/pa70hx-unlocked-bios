Fully Featured BIOS for Clevo PA70Hx (Kabylake)

The BIOS is a little buggy at the moment, but it should work fine overall.

Please be responsible with your electronics and use this at your own risk. Please kindly do not come to me and say "you broke my laptop", this works fine on my laptop afaict

Things that don't work
1. GPU Muxing doesn't work in BIOS (Can still be changed in Windows using Clevo Control Centre)
2. Full screen logo display doesn't seem to work, you will get an empty windows startup screen with the little spinner, no clevo logo
3. You might get stuck on the "Advanced" page if you go over stuff too quickly, reset (reboot) fixes this (can't esc, press f4 if you want to save the current config)
4. I haven't tested anything to do with power mgmnt since I don't really wanna brick my laptop and I don't know what I am doing, use those at your own risk
5. Does not wake from s3

If you get stuck in an un-postable state, you can hold Fn+D to reset your BIOS to default settings.
